# Neural Network Development Dashboard (2N2D)

**2N2D** is a web application designed to streamline and simplify the development of Machine Learning models. It empowers users without technical expertise to create high-performance models intuitively, while experienced ML developers can focus on critical decisions without wasting time on debugging, result interpretation, or model tuning.

The primary goal is to democratize access to this innovative technology that plays an increasingly important role in our daily lives.

## Features

### ONNX File Analysis and Visualization
- Upload and analyze ONNX machine learning models.
- Automatically detect architecture, operations, and activations.
- Replicate and retrain models for testing and optimization.

### CSV Dataset Processing

### Automatic Machine Learning Model Optimization
Three optimization methods are available:

- **Brute-force**: Retrains the model using multiple configurations, then selects the best-performing one.
- **Genetic**: Uses a genetic algorithm to evolve the model architecture across generations.
- **Neuro-evolutionary**: A more advanced genetic algorithm that modifies the entire neural network topology to generate new, problem-specific architectures.

### Machine Learning Lessons
- Built-in educational modules explaining ML concepts.
- Designed for beginners looking to understand the principles behind neural networks.

### AI Chatbot Assistant
- Intelligent chatbot with access to user models, datasets, and lessons.
- Provides real-time guidance, suggestions, and answers throughout the development process.
